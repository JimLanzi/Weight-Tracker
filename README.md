# Weight-Tracker
Python/Jupyter Notebook for tracking progress during weight loss program.

Program reads date/weight data from a text file, fits an exponential 
weight loss model curve to the data, and allows the user to observe 
overall trends and predict when certain weight milestones will be achieved.

A command line script is also included for running in Termux on  tablet.

Currently the notebook and python script are set up for personal use
with hardcoded milestone weights. However, it could be made general
purpose.
